## Development

### File structure

The plugin code itself is placed in the ./src folder, which has the following tree:
```
    ./src
        - __tests__
        - baseUI (the app's user interface for options page and sidepanel)
        - components
            - effects (contains components that brings simpler effects to other components (e.g. rotation))
            - icons (various reusable svg icons used in any other components for styling)
            - utils (various components used all over the plugin. Each component file contains info on whether or not they are reusable)
        - interfaces (typescript datatypes, applied to most features all over the plugin) 
        - redux (global states for certain features, to avoid prop drilling at certain scenarios)
        - views (plugin's pages, used by the baseUI to render page contents wrapped in the base UI)
            - dashboard
            - settings
            - sidepanel
        ...
        App.tsx
        index.tsx
```

#### File and folder name formats

All folders and files follows the following format: __[my-file-name.tsx]__

#### Component guidelines

- In this project, all functions returning the type __JSX.Element__ is considered a component. These should always be placed in their own files.
- A component should NOT declare other components. Preferably, no functions should be declared inside a component unless it is motivated to do so (e.g. when the function sets states at some point).
- Each variable and function should be declared with appropriate datatype. Create a new interface or extend a current one, when creating a new feature
- Refactored components should be placed in their own folder and follow a specific naming convention:

```
    ./src
        ...
        - components
            - utils
                - [my_component]
                    - [my_component].tsx
                    - a_component_specific_function.tsx
                    - a_event_handler.ts
                    - child_components
                        - child_component_a.tsx
                        - child_component_b.tsx
```

Consider refactoring components if they become too big or clumsy to work with.

### Commands

Before you begin, make sure Node Package Manager (npm) is installed on your computer. The build and testing
commands depend on this.


__Build__

```
npm run build
```

The build will be available in the ./dist folder. This folder can be loaded
as a unpacked webextension into the browser. This folder is also used when packaging the extension
for distribution.

NOTE: There is no bundling as of now. That will be added later.

__Test__

```
npm run test
```

Run unit and integration tests (JEST). The tests are available in /src/__tests__. The coverage is presented in ./coverage/Icov-report/index.html

Run this command after changing existing components, to check if anything related to user interaction gets broken. Add new tests when adding new components or features. 
The tests are written to test user interaction with the components.

### Install unpacked dev version in Chrome or Edge

1. Clone this repository to a folder on your computer
2. Open Google Chrome (preferably. Optimization for Firefox and Edge will be done at a later time)
3. Build the project
3. Go to Chrome's menu -> Extensions -> Manage Extension
4. Turn on Developer mode and click "Load unpacked"
5. Head for ***/tabfolders/dist/*** and select it

- __Open options page:__ Click "Details" in the extension's box. Scroll down and click "Extension options"
- __Open the sidepanel:__ Click the <img src="./img/brand/brand.png" width="20" height="20" style="margin: 0 4px" /> icon in your browser's toolbar
